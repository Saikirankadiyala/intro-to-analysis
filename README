<h2> Introduction to Data Analysis for Scientists <h2>

While teaching UC-Berkeley's Physics 111 Advanced Laboratory course, I've found that many students struggle with data analysis solely because they have no programming experience.  To address this, I am creating tutorials that will cover subjects such as an introduction to programming, importing data, curve fitting, etc.  The tutorials will be written as iPython notebooks.

And of these notebooks can be viewed at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/ using the raw data URL.
